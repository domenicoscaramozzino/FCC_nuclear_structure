# FCC nuclear structure
This Matlab code contains an adaptation of the Face-Centered-Cubic (FCC) lattice model proposed by Norman D. Cook ("Models of the Atomic Nucleus: Unification Through a Lattice of Nucleons", 2nd Edition, 2010) for visualizing and modeling the structures of atomic nuclei. The code contains an interactive interface to insert input data.

First, you will be asked which nucleus you want to analyze, specifying the number of protons (Z) and neutrons (N). In case of Fe56 you type Z = 26 and N = 30. Following the default build-up proposed by Cook, the code will place protons and neutrons in the proper FCC positions and calculate basic features such as the Binding Energy.
