# FCC nuclear structure
Code to use the FCC lattice model for atomic nuclei following the theory of Norman D. Cook

This Matlab code contains an adaptation of the Face-Centered-Cubic (FCC) lattice model proposed by Norman D. Cook ("Models of the Atomic Nucleus: Unification Through a Lattice of Nucleons", 2nd Edition, 2010) for visualizing and modeling the structures of atomic nuclei. The code contains an interactive interface to insert input data.

First, you will be ask which nucleus you want to analyze, e.g. type Z = 26 and N = 30 for Fe^56.
